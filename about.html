            <h2>Brief History:</h2>
             <!--small paragraph describing the SME's brief background and mission-->
            <p>In 2022, Precious Radebe founded Empowering the Nation to offer skills. Her business was motivated by the fact that her parents and other older family members were never given the opportunity to further their education or get a formal degree, and she provides classes in Johannesburg. Both the six-month learnership and the six-week short skills training program have empowered hundreds of gardeners and domestic workers and equipped them with more marketable abilities.
